Competition Manager's documentation
===================================

*Competition Manager* aims to be a tool for organizing short-span programming
competitions in a local network.

Existing real-world are not suitable for short programming contests of several
minutes to several hours, but so is this solution.
Altough this software is designed to host only a single competition at the same
time, it is possible to run many competition concurrently.

Competition participants, organizers and judges only need a web browser to
interact with the application.

Basically, *Competition Manager* itself needs a machine which acts as a server
or host for the competition only.

This application targets private or high-school competitions.

The original motivation for creating this application was the need to organize
a local programming competition between several schools.

Main features:
  * Easy-to-use administration interface
  * Quick problem definition
  * Source compiler and auto-evaluation of code submissions
